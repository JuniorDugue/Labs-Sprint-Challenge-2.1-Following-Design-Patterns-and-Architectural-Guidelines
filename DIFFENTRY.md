# Diff Entry

Any time that you've deviated from your original plan, as documented in your release canvas, we want you to tell us about why you pivoted from the plan which you agreed upon as a team.

**Please respond to the following prompt to detail out the reasons your team pivoted away from the plan upon which you agreed as a team.**

### Prompt 1

As you have now been in the process of delivering and building your product, we'd like to know what has changed along the way:

- Describe how the requirements of the features you're building have changed.
- What caused these requirements to change?
- **Engineering Students:** What types of architectural requirements changed? Did you have to make any trade-offs or add any new packages/libraries or dependencies to your application's technical stack in order to meet the new changes? **Please describe, why/why not?**
- **UX Student:** Describe any design patterns or users flows that had to change as a result of the requirements above.
